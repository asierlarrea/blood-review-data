### **2. Cell Type Biology**
- Do immune cells systematically express more proteins than non-immune cells?
- Which cell types have the most similar proteomes?
- How do T cell subsets (CD4+ vs CD8+) differ in protein expression?

### **3. Protein Function & Abundance**
- What functional categories are over-represented in blood?
- Is there a relationship between protein abundance and functional category?
- How do immunoglobulin profiles reflect immune status?

### **4. Technical Considerations**
- Which databases are most comprehensive for specific cell types?

- What is the optimal database combination for proteomics studies?

### **5. Biological Insights**
- Are there cell type-specific protein signatures?
- How do abundance patterns relate to protein function?
- Which proteins are universally expressed vs. cell-type specific?

## üìà **Additional Analyses to Consider**

### **Temporal Analysis** (if time-series data available)
- Protein expression changes over time
- Stability of different protein classes
- Dynamic range changes

### **Network Analysis**
- Protein-protein interaction networks
- Functional pathway enrichment
- Hub proteins in different cell types

### **Statistical Modeling**

- Predictive models for cell type classification

### **Validation Studies**
- Cross-database validation of findings
- Literature comparison of key proteins
- Experimental validation priorities

## üîß **Running the New Analyses**

To execute all new analyses:

```bash
# Run each analysis script
Rscript Figure6_database_correlation.R
Rscript Figure7_abundance_analysis.R
Rscript Figure8_functional_analysis.R
Rscript Figure9_comparative_analysis.R
```

All plots will be saved in the `plots/` directory as high-resolution TIFF files.

## üìù **Expected Outcomes**

These analyses will help you:

1. **Optimize Database Selection** - Identify the most informative database combinations
2. **Understand Biological Patterns** - Reveal cell type-specific and functional patterns
3. **Guide Future Studies** - Prioritize targets for experimental validation
4. **Publication Impact** - Provide comprehensive comparative analysis for high-impact journals

## üé® **Plot Descriptions**

Each script generates publication-ready plots with:
- High-resolution TIFF output (600 DPI)
- Professional color schemes
- Clear titles and legends
- Statistical annotations where appropriate
- Consistent formatting across all figures
