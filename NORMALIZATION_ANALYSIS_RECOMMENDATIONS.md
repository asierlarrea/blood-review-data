# Blood Proteome Analysis Review & Recommendations

**Analysis Date:** 2023-10-27

This document provides a comprehensive review of the blood proteome analysis project, addressing questions of proteome coverage, data combination strategies, code optimization, and suggestions for future analyses.

## 1. Coverage of the Blood Proteome in Different Databases

Your analysis correctly addresses this question by calculating the number of unique proteins identified in each database.

-   **How it's done:** The `01_plasma_protein_analysis_refactored.R` script loads each data source, processes it to get a list of unique gene symbols, and counts them.
-   **Key Output Table:** The summary statistics are saved in `outputs/tables/01_plasma_protein_analysis/plasma_protein_summary.csv`. This table provides the exact counts of unique proteins per database and technology type.
-   **Key Figures for This Question:**
    -   `outputs/plots/01_plasma_protein_analysis/01_plasma_proteins_by_source.png`: This bar chart is the primary visualization for comparing the protein coverage across different databases.
    -   `outputs/plots/01_plasma_protein_analysis/02_plasma_proteins_by_technology.png`: This plot provides a higher-level summary, grouping the databases by technology (e.g., Mass Spectrometry vs. PEA).

These outputs clearly show the contribution of each database to the total measured blood proteome.

## 2. How to Combine Multiple Databases

This is a critical challenge due to the different technologies, units, and inherent biases of each database. Your scripts implement and evaluate an excellent strategy for this.

-   **The Problem:** Direct comparison of abundance values (e.g., spectral counts from GPMDB vs. ppm from PAXDB) is not meaningful. The data must be transformed onto a common scale.
-   **Your Solution:** The scripts explore three main steps:
    1.  **Log Transformation:** This is a standard and necessary first step to handle the wide dynamic range of protein abundance data and reduce the skewness of the distributions.
    2.  **Z-Score Normalization:** This method standardizes the distribution of each dataset to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It's useful for comparing the relative abundance of proteins *within* each dataset but is less effective at making the absolute distributions identical across datasets.
    3.  **Quantile Normalization:** This is a more powerful technique that forces the distributions of all datasets to be exactly the same. This is generally the **recommended approach** when the goal is to create a single, integrated data matrix for downstream analyses like clustering or machine learning, as it removes systematic technical variations between the datasets.
-   **Key Figures for This Question:**
    -   `outputs/plots/01_plasma_protein_analysis/07_dist_density_comparison.png`: This set of density plots is the most important visualization for this topic. It clearly shows how the distributions of different databases look before normalization (Log10) and how Z-score and Quantile Normalization align them. You can visually see that Quantile Normalization makes the distributions nearly identical.
    

The scripts correctly conclude that quantile normalization is superior for creating a harmonized dataset, and this is standard best practice for this type of cross-platform integration.

## 3. Code Review and Optimization

The project is well-structured, particularly with the refactored script and utility functions. Here is a summary of what's done well and suggestions for further improvement.

### What's Done Well:
-   **Centralized Configuration:** Using `scripts/config/analysis_config.R` is excellent for maintainability.
-   **Modularity:** The `scripts/utilities/` directory and the function-oriented structure of `01_plasma_protein_analysis_refactored.R` make the code clean and reusable.
-   **Automated Reporting:** The generation of a markdown summary in the refactored script is a great feature.
-   **Data-driven Visualization:** Plots are generated directly from the data, which is a core principle of reproducible research.

### Recommendations for Optimization:
1.  **Consolidate Scripts:** The `01_plasma_protein_analysis_refactored.R` script is superior. To avoid confusion, I recommend:
    -   Deleting `scripts/01_plasma_protein_analysis.R`.
    -   Renaming `scripts/01_plasma_protein_analysis_refactored.R` to `scripts/01_plasma_protein_analysis.R`.
2.  **Standardize Other Scripts:** The clear, modular structure of the refactored `01_...` script should be applied to the other analysis scripts (`02_...` to `05_...`). This would create a consistent and professional codebase.
3.  **Dependency Management with `renv`:** To ensure long-term reproducibility, consider using the `renv` package. Running `renv::init()` will create a project-specific library and a `renv.lock` file that records the exact versions of all R package dependencies. This is more robust than the current `load_packages.R` utility.
4.  **Enhance Parameterization:** Move hardcoded values from scripts into `analysis_config.R`. For example, the list of biomarker genes in `03_biomarker_plasma_analysis.R` could be defined in the config file.

## 4. Suggested Future Analyses

Your current analysis provides a strong foundation. Here are some suggestions for next steps that would add significant value:

1.  **Visualize Database Overlap with an UpSet Plot:**
    -   **Question:** Which proteins are unique to each database, and which are commonly detected by multiple databases?
    -   **Method:** A bar chart shows the *number* of proteins, but an **UpSet plot** shows the *intersections*. This is more informative than a Venn diagram for many datasets.
    -   **Tool:** The `UpSetR` package in R is excellent for this. You can add a new script, `06_database_overlap_analysis.R`, to generate this plot from the `data_list` object created in script 01.

2.  **Functional Enrichment Analysis:**
    -   **Question:** What biological pathways or cellular functions are represented in the combined blood proteome?
    -   **Method:** After creating the quantile-normalized, integrated dataset, perform Gene Ontology (GO) or KEGG pathway enrichment analysis.
    -   **Tools:** Packages like `clusterProfiler` or `fgsea` can be used to identify significantly enriched biological terms. This would provide biological context to your data.

3.  **Analyze Protein Abundance Correlations:**
    -   **Question:** For proteins detected by multiple MS-based methods, do their abundance levels correlate across databases?
    -   **Method:** After normalization, create scatter plots comparing the abundance of common proteins between pairs of high-quality MS datasets (e.g., HPA MS vs. PAXDB). A high correlation would increase confidence in the quantification.

4.  **Biomarker Analysis Expansion:**
    -   The `03_biomarker_plasma_analysis.R` script is a great start. This can be expanded to test for differential abundance of these biomarkers between technologies or to see if they fall into a particular abundance range in the combined dataset.
