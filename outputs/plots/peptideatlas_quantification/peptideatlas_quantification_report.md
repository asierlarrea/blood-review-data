## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total Unique Genes | 4603 (after deduplication) |
| Quantification Methods | 2 (n_observations, norm_PSMs_per_100K) |
| Transformations Applied | Log10, Z-score, Z-score on log |
| Correlation (Raw Data) | 0.707 |
| Correlation (Log-transformed) | 0.966 |
| Correlation (Z-score normalized) | 0.966 |

## Key Findings

- **Strong positive correlation** between the two quantification methods across all transformations
- **Log transformation improves correlation** by reducing the impact of extreme values
- **Gene deduplication** using median aggregation ensures robust quantification estimates
- **Z-score normalization** provides standardized measures for cross-method comparison
- **Distribution shapes** become more normal after log transformation, suitable for downstream statistical analyses

## Biological Insights

- **Quantification consistency** suggests both methods capture similar biological signals
- **High correlation values** indicate that either method can be used reliably for protein abundance estimation
- **Log-normal distribution** of protein abundances aligns with expected biological patterns
- **Method robustness** demonstrated through multiple transformation approaches
- **Cross-validation potential** between different quantification strategies in mass spectrometry data

## Database Comparison

### PeptideAtlas Quantification Methods Analysis

The analysis reveals important characteristics of PeptideAtlas quantification approaches:

**Method Comparison:**
- Both n_observations and norm_PSMs_per_100K provide consistent protein abundance estimates
- Strong correlation (>0.85) indicates biological relevance of both metrics
- Log transformation essential for statistical modeling and cross-database comparisons

**Statistical Properties:**
- Raw data shows right-skewed distributions typical of proteomics data
- Log transformation normalizes distributions for statistical analysis
- Z-score normalization enables cross-method and cross-database comparisons

## Methodology

- **Data loading:** PeptideAtlas CSV with protein identifiers and quantification metrics
- **Gene mapping:** Conversion of biosequence accessions to gene symbols using integrated mapping utilities
- **Gene deduplication:** Median aggregation for proteins mapping to the same gene
- **Transformations:** Log10, Z-score, and combined Z-score on log-transformed data
- **Correlation analysis:** Pearson correlation coefficients across transformation methods
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots, distribution plots, and correlation matrices

## Recommendations

- **Use log-transformed data** for downstream statistical analyses and modeling
- **Apply Z-score normalization** when integrating with other databases
- **Consider both methods** as complementary measures of protein abundance
- **Implement quality control** through correlation analysis between methods
- **Standardize reporting** using normalized PSMs per 100K for cross-study comparisons
