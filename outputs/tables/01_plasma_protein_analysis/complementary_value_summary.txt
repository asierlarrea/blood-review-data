COMPLEMENTARY VALUE ANALYSIS
===========================

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC HIGH-CONFIDENCE COVERAGE:
- PeptideAtlas alone: 73 proteins (26.0%)
- QuantMS alone: 15 proteins (5.3%)
- Combined platforms: 81 proteins (28.8%)

ADDED VALUE BREAKDOWN:
- Synergistic detection (both high): 7 proteins
- PeptideAtlas unique advantage: 66 proteins  
- QuantMS unique advantage: 8 proteins
- Additional coverage from combining: +8 proteins (11.0% increase)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Multi-platform approach increases high-confidence detection by 11.0%
2. Each platform contributes unique high-confidence proteins
3. 7 proteins benefit from synergistic detection in both platforms
4. Platform complementarity enhances overall proteome characterization
