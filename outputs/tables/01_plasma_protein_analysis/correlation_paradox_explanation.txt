SIMPSON'S PARADOX EXPLANATION
============================

OVERALL CORRELATION: r = 0.502 (POSITIVE)
Group Correlations: High r = -0.014, Medium r = -0.280, Low r = -0.278 (NEGATIVE/LOW)

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
1. BETWEEN-GROUP EFFECT (drives overall positive correlation):
   - High group: PeptideAtlas mean = 1.95, QuantMS mean = 0.71
   - Medium group: PeptideAtlas mean = 0.45, QuantMS mean = -0.02  
   - Low group: PeptideAtlas mean = -0.12, QuantMS mean = -0.97
   
   Both platforms AGREE on ranking: High > Medium > Low groups
   This creates the positive overall correlation.

2. WITHIN-GROUP EFFECT (creates negative group correlations):
   - Within each group, platforms DISAGREE on relative protein rankings
   - When PeptideAtlas says protein A > protein B within a group,
     QuantMS often says protein B > protein A
   
3. MATHEMATICAL EXPLANATION:
   Overall correlation = Weighted combination of:
   a) Between-group correlation (POSITIVE - both platforms separate groups similarly)
   b) Within-group correlations (NEGATIVE - platforms disagree within groups)
   
   The between-group effect dominates, creating positive overall correlation
   despite negative within-group correlations.

IMPLICATIONS:
- Platforms agree on broad expression categories (high/medium/low)
- Platforms disagree on fine-scale quantitative differences
- This suggests different measurement biases or dynamic ranges
