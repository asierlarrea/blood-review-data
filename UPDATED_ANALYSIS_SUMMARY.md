# Updated Blood Proteomics Analysis - Raw Database Integration

## Overview

The blood proteomics analysis pipeline has been significantly enhanced to work **directly with raw database files** instead of relying on summary files (bubble.csv, plasma_upset.csv, etc.). This provides much richer, more accurate, and more detailed analyses.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Data Source Transformation
- **Before**: Analysis based on pre-computed summary files (bubble.csv, upset files)
- **After**: Direct reading and processing of raw database files:
  - `PeptideAtlas.csv` - Normalized PSMs per 100K
  - `PaxDb_*.csv` - Protein abundance in ppm for each cell type
  - `HPA_*.csv` - Protein concentrations (MS, PEA, Immunoassay)
  - `GPMDB_*.csv` - Spectral counts for plasma, platelet, erythrocyte
  - `PXD*.csv` - LFQ intensities from ProteomeXchange studies

### 2. Script Updates

#### Figure6_database_correlation.R
- **Enhanced**: Now performs protein-level overlap analysis
- **New Features**:
  - Jaccard similarity calculations between databases
  - Protein coverage matrices across databases and cell types
  - Database specialization ratios (unique proteins per database)
  - Cross-database protein consistency analysis

#### Figure7_abundance_analysis.R
- **Enhanced**: Quantitative abundance analysis with actual values
- **New Features**:
  - Dynamic range analysis across databases
  - Abundance distributions by cell type (ridge plots)
  - HPA concentration analysis with different detection methods
  - High-abundance protein identification across datasets
  - Abundance vs coverage efficiency metrics

#### Figure8_functional_analysis.R
- **Enhanced**: Functional categorization based on protein descriptions
- **New Features**:
  - Automated functional classification using keyword patterns
  - Immunoglobulin type identification (IgG, IgA, IgM, etc.)
  - Functional word clouds from protein descriptions
  - Database functional specialization analysis
  - Cell type functional profiles

#### Figure9_comparative_analysis.R
- **Enhanced**: Cross-database protein comparison and cell type analysis
- **New Features**:
  - UpSet plots for database and cell type overlaps
  - Immune vs non-immune cell protein comparisons
  - T cell subset analysis (CD4 vs CD8)
  - Database coverage efficiency analysis
  - Cross-database protein consistency metrics

## Benefits of Raw Data Integration

### 1. **Protein-Level Analysis**
- Direct access to protein identifiers enables cross-database matching
- Ability to track individual proteins across multiple databases and cell types
- Protein overlap analysis using actual protein sets rather than counts

### 2. **Quantitative Analysis**
- Access to actual abundance values (ppm, mg/L, LFQ intensities, spectral counts)
- Dynamic range calculations showing detection sensitivity differences
- Abundance distribution analysis across cell types and databases

### 3. **Functional Insights**
- Protein description parsing for functional categorization
- Immunoglobulin class identification and analysis
- Cell type-specific protein functional profiles

### 4. **Comparative Biology**
- Immune vs non-immune cell proteome comparisons
- T cell subset protein expression differences
- Database complementarity and uniqueness analysis

### 5. **Quality Assessment**
- Database coverage efficiency metrics
- Cross-database validation and consistency
- Detection method comparison (MS vs PEA vs Immunoassay)

## New Analysis Capabilities

### Database Integration Analysis
- **Jaccard Similarity**: Quantifies database overlap using actual protein sets
- **Specialization Metrics**: Identifies database-unique proteins
- **Coverage Efficiency**: Proteins detected per cell type per database

### Abundance Profiling
- **Dynamic Range**: Quantifies detection span (log10 orders of magnitude)
- **Cell Type Profiles**: PaxDb abundance comparison across blood cell types
- **Method Comparison**: HPA concentration differences by detection method

### Functional Classification
- **Automated Categorization**: 7 functional categories based on protein descriptions
- **Immunoglobulin Analysis**: Heavy/light chain identification and quantification
- **Keyword Analysis**: Most frequent terms in protein descriptions

### Comparative Biology
- **Cell Category Analysis**: Immune vs non-immune proteome differences
- **T Cell Subsets**: CD4 vs CD8 protein expression comparison
- **Cross-Database Validation**: Proteins consistently detected across databases

## Output Structure

The analysis now generates organized outputs in themed directories:

```
plots/
├── 01_Database_Analysis/     # Database coverage, correlations, specialization
├── 03_Abundance_Analysis/    # Protein abundance distributions and dynamics
├── 05_Functional_Analysis/   # Protein functional categories and immunoglobulins
└── 08_Database_Comparison/   # Cross-database comparisons and efficiency
```

## Data Requirements

The enhanced analysis requires the following raw database files:
- `PeptideAtlas.csv` - Plasma protein atlas data
- `PaxDb_*.csv` - Cell-type specific abundance data
- `HPA_*.csv` - Human Protein Atlas concentration data
- `GPMDB_*.csv` - Global Proteome Machine database data
- `PXD*.csv` - ProteomeXchange study data

## Technical Improvements

### 1. **Protein ID Standardization**
- Removes isoform variants (e.g., P12345-1 → P12345)
- Handles multi-protein entries (semicolon-separated)
- Cleans database-specific prefixes (e.g., 9606.ENSP)

### 2. **Data Quality Control**
- Filters invalid protein IDs and abundance values
- Handles missing data appropriately
- Validates data consistency across files

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
- Efficient data reading with appropriate parsing
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Parallel processing where applicable

## Results Summary

The enhanced analysis provides:
- **Protein-level insights** instead of just counts
- **Quantitative comparisons** using actual abundance values
- **Functional categorization** based on protein descriptions
- **Cross-database validation** and complementarity analysis
- **Biological interpretation** of cell type differences

This represents a significant upgrade from summary-based analysis to comprehensive raw data integration, enabling deeper biological insights and more robust conclusions about blood proteomics across multiple databases and cell types.
