### 3. Standardized Elements
- **Consistent color palettes** across all panels
- **Standardized font sizes** (Title: 16pt, Subtitle: 12pt, Panel titles: 12pt)
- **Common layout principles** (left-to-right, top-to-bottom information flow)
- **Unified legends** and axis formatting

### 4. Quality Assurance
- High-resolution output (300 DPI minimum)
- Readable text at publication scales
- Color-blind friendly palettes
- Clean, professional styling
